  <strong>Responsys&reg; Permission Marketing Policy</strong><br>
  <br>
  <font color=#000000 size=2>
  This permission marketing policy contains terms that are applicable to Responsys, Responsys' clients, and our clients' customers. Responsys provides email marketing solutions to its clients, including many Fortune&nbsp;500 companies. Our clients use the Responsys Interact&reg; product as a solution to deliver permission-based personalized communications to their prospects and customers. Responsys expressly forbids any of our clients from using the Responsys Interact product to deliver unsolicited commercial email and unsolicited bulk email. The term &quot;commercial email&quot; as used in this permission marketing policy does not include administrative email such as shipping notifications, employee notices, notices required by regulation or law, invoices, account statements, order confirmations, and other transactional and relationship email, as defined by <span style="white-space:nowrap">CAN-SPAM.</span><br>
  <br>
  <b>How does Responsys avoid &quot;spam&quot;?</b><br>
  <br>
  Each client who uses the Responsys Interact product enters into a service agreement with Responsys agreeing to comply with our permission marketing policies, as well as all laws and regulations related to their email marketing activities. Responsys thoroughly investigates any complaint that a client is delivering unsolicited commercial email. For online registrations, Responsys asks its clients to provide Responsys with the online opt-in information for the email recipient who submitted a complaint that he or she received unsolicited commercial email. This online opt-in information includes the following:
  <li>the date and time the recipient opted in
  <li>the Internet Protocol address of the machine from which the recipient opted in
  <br>
  <br>If the individual enrolled via postal mail or other written means, Responsys asks its clients to provide the enrollment form; if the individual opted in via the telephone, then Responsys requests the script that was used to gain the individual's permission. Reports of a client sending unsolicited email may result in the suspension or termination of the client's access to the Responsys Interact product.<br>
  <br>
  <b>How does Responsys protect your privacy?</b><br>
  <br>
  Responsys employs strict security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of data placed on the Responsys network. For additional details, review our <a href="/privacy.htm">Privacy Policy</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <b>How can you stop a company from sending you more email?</b><br>
  <br>
  Every Responsys client using the Responsys Interact product to send commercial email must include in each commercial email message (i) clear instructions on how the recipient can unsubscribe from receiving future commercial email, and (ii) its physical address. Responsys understands that many illegitimate online marketers use unsubscribe links to verify whether an email address is valid, but Responsys does not allow the delivery of unsolicited commercial email through its Responsys Interact product. Therefore, if you follow the unsubscribe instructions in the email, Responsys will work with the client to make sure that you do not receive future commercial email. Our clients are required to comply with any commercial email opt-out request in accordance with <span style="white-space:nowrap">CAN-SPAM</span> and all other applicable laws. If you have difficulty unsubscribing from a client's email campaigns using the instructions provided in the email message, or if you have questions regarding the opt-out mechanism, please contact the
