You may also request specific information regarding the types of Technical Data collected and retained by Asurion as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">APPLICATION AND MOBILE DEVICE SECURITY:</b></p>
<p>Asurion has implemented measures to help protect against the unauthorized access, loss, misuse and alteration of the Technical Data and Your PII. Asurion utilizes security measures and encryption technology to help protect the integrity of the Technical Data and your PII. After the Application is installed, the Technical Data and your PII generally is encrypted before being transmitted over the Internet to Asurion. The Technical Data and your PII will be encrypted by your phone before it is transferred to Asurion storage systems. Notwithstanding the foregoing, technology limitations may prevent encryption in some instances. Once Asurion receives the Technical Data and your PII, it is authenticated and protected by a firewall and/or encryption.</p>
<p>Asurion uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to protect against loss, theft, misuse, disclosure, alteration and destruction of or unauthorized access to your PII. Asurion cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information that Asurion receives on your behalf to operate the Services or that you transmit to Asurion, including your PII and you do so at your own risk. Asurion also cannot guarantee that such information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of Asurion's physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. While Asurion uses commercially reasonable data encryption, Asurion cannot ensure or warrant the security of any of Your Technical Data or Your PII while in transit from Your mobile device to our servers. Asurion will notify You of any confirmed security breach of Your Technical Data or PII to the extent required by and in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Asurion may attempt to notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps or Asurion may post notification on www.Asurion.com if a security breach has been confirmed by Asurion. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing in which case Asurion will notify you in writing of such security breach.</p>
<p>Your mobile device may contain other third party software or third party applications which collect and transmit PII or other Technical Data. Asurion is not responsible for any PII or other information which may be stored or transmitted by any such third party software. In addition, Asurion is not responsible for any PII or other information that you display publicly or that becomes publicly known as a result of Your actions.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS AND WEBSITES:</b></p>
<p>The Application may contain embedded links to other third party websites or to applications operated by non-affiliated or independent third parties. Please be aware that those applications and websites may collect PII or Technical Data from You about Your visit. These website and applications have not necessarily been reviewed by Asurion and are maintained by third parties over which Asurion exercises no control. Accordingly, Asurion expressly disclaims any responsibility for the privacy policies, information collection practices, content, accuracy of the information, and/or quality of products or services provided by or advertised on these third-party applications and websites. Moreover, these links do not imply an endorsement with respect to any third party, websites or the applications or services provided by any third party. You should review the privacy policies for any websites or applications that you use, before using the application or website and providing Your PII or allowing access to your Technical Data. Asurion is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any third party applications or websites that may be mentioned on, or accessible from, the Application or through the Services.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">CHILDREN UNDER 13</b></p>
<p>The Application and Services provided by Asurion are not directed to persons under 13. Asurion does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If you become aware that your child is accessing the Application or Services and providing PII without your consent, please contact us by using the information provided in the Contact and Electronic Communications section of this Privacy Policy. Asurion will take steps to remove PII from Asurion Storage Systems and terminate the account should Asurion determine that a child under 13 has accessed the Services.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS:</b></p>
<p>This notification is required under California law. Under California law, California residents may opt-out of Asurion disclosing personal information about them to third parties for their marketing purposes. If You are a California resident and do not want Asurion to disclose Your information to other companies for their marketing purposes, please contact Asurion by any of the ways described in the Contact and Electronic Communications Section above. Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of PII the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. To request a copy of such information, please contact Asurion by any of the ways described in the Contact and Electronic Communications section above, and Asurion will respond within 30 days as required by law.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">SOCIAL MEDIA:</b></p>
<p>Any information, communications, or material of any type or nature that you submit to a social media platform or website such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter through Your use of the Application or the Services by email, posting, messaging, uploading, downloading, or otherwise (collectively, a &quot;Submission&quot;), is done at Your own risk and without any expectation of privacy. Asurion cannot control the actions of other users of any social media platform or website and Asurion is therefore not responsible for any content or Submissions contained on such sites and platforms. By utilizing any functionality contained as part of the Application that permits Submissions to social media platform or website, you are representing and warranting to Asurion that you have reviewed the applicable Privacy Policy and terms of use of such social media platform or website and that you will abide by all such provisions contained therein. Additionally, in the event that Asurion offers functionality through the Application or Services that permits the posting of Your information on message boards or any other interactive or social-type feature, please be aware that these areas may allow you to publicly post, and share with other users, certain messages, content, or other information (e.g., stories, pictures, ingredients, tips, etc.). Asurion encourages you to be wary of giving out any PII that may appear in such public forums. The information you post can be collected and used by people you don't know. Asurion cannot guarantee the privacy and safety of these areas and is therefore not responsible for any information you choose to post. Your use of these features is fully at your own risk.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">INTERNATIONAL USERS:</b></p>
<p><b>FOR NON US RESIDENTS</b>: We may transfer information that we collect about you, including Your Technical Data and Your PII , to subsidiary and affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from Your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If You are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that You are transferring information about You, including Your Technical data and Your PII, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as the European Union, and You consent to: the transfer of information about You, including Your Technical Data and Your PII, to the U.S.; and the use and disclosure of information about You, including Your Technical Data and Your PII, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 20px;">MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT:</b></p>
<p>Asurion has implemented various measures to monitor compliance with and enforce the elements in this Privacy Policy.
