<p class="question">
Why is a W8-BEN form required?
</p>
<p>
Individuals or companies outside of the US are subject to a 30% withholding tax on income they receive from US sources.  However, there are exemptions so you need to fill out the W8-BEN form to:
<ul>
<li>establish you are not a US person/business; </li>
<li>claim you are the ‘beneficial owner’ of the foreign income; </li>
<li>confirm you are a non-resident claiming exemption from the 30% (if you are eligible) </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="question">
I received a “B Notice Letter”  in the mail.  What is this and what action is needed?
</p>
<p>
Per the CP2100 B Notice letter that AT&T received from the IRS, the vendor listed below has been placed on payment hold. Essentially this means, the tax information on file does not match the IRS database.  Some discrepancy exists between the information you provided on your W-9 and the IRS system. AT&T is required to withhold 28% of all payments owed to the vendor and remit it to the IRS until the correct tax reporting information is received and verified. Submit a copy of the latest dated IRS W9 to AT&T Tower Asset Group Lease Administration (TAG-LA) for processing. 
</p>
